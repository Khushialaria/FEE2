                <p>Great Stories for Children is a collection of some of Ruskin Bond's most delightful children's stories. It stars Toto, the monkey, who takes a fancy to the narrator's aunt, much to her dismay, a python besotted by his own appearance, a mischievous ghost who enjoys stirring up the house when things get dull, three young children stranded in a storm on the Haunted Hilland Ruskin Bond himself, who happens to make the acquaintance of a ghost at a resort late one night.</p>

                <h3>calculating stars</h3>
                <p> <b>Author:</b> Mary Robinette Kowal</p>
                <p>On a cold spring night in 1952, a huge meteorite fell to earth and obliterated much of the east coast of the United States, including Washington D.C. The ensuing climate cataclysm will soon render the earth inhospitable for humanity, as the last such meteorite did for the dinosaurs. This looming threat calls for a radically accelerated effort to colonize space, and requires a much larger share of humanity to take part in the process.

                    Elma York’s experience as a WASP pilot and mathematician earns her a place in the International Aerospace Coalition’s attempts to put man on the moon, as a calculator. But with so many skilled and experienced women pilots and scientists involved with the program, it doesn’t take long before Elma begins to wonder why they can’t go into space, too.
                    
                    Elma’s drive to become the first Lady Astronaut is so strong that even the most dearly held conventions of society may not stand a chance against her.</p>
